Hey John!

Hope you're having a great day! I wanted to touch base and remind you about our Skool community, where you can join us for weekly coaching calls every Tuesday at 6 PM Eastern time. It's a fantastic space that's almost hit the 500 user milestone, and we'd be thrilled to have a seasoned software engineer like you on board!

This community is an excellent opportunity for you to connect with like-minded professionals, ask questions, and get support for your projects. Plus, if you're enjoying the AI-related content, you'll be happy to know there's a wealth of other videos on my channel for you to explore.
